## <a name="started"></a>Getting Started
This repo contains the commands and the script used to generate the pangenome graphs and the regions used in the CRHPG paper. To cite it, please see [here](#cite).
The scripts take as granted that the tools have already been installed in the computer/cluster used and the haplotypes have been downloaded.

To download the haplotypes, you can go to [Google Brain Genomics website][Google Brain Genomics] and [Human Pangenome Reference Consortium website][Human Pangenome Reference Consortium]
Loci sequences are provided in a folder of this repo and have been downloaded from the NCBI dataset.
